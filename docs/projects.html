        <p>Here are some of the projects I've done for ENGCMP 0610: Composing Digital Media.</p>

        <h2>Project #1: Audio Narrative</h2>
            <p>The goal for this project was to successfully layer and edit sounds in order to tell a story.</p>
            <p>My audio narrative is portrays a student studying at a rainy cafe (Studying in a Rainy Cafe). The sounds include a barista reading out a coffee order, a student writing and typing on a computer, and background sounds of rain and people talking.</p>

        <h2>Project #2: Visual Argument</h2>
         <p>The objective of this visual argument was to make a claim through the use of an image/text. </p>
         <p>My goal for this project was to show the difference between what we see on our phones, essentially a highlight reel, versus what is actually real life. Hence, the title for my visual argument "distorted reality". Using the image of the trash-filled, dirty beach as the "reality" and a cleaned up, beautiful beach on the phone as the "social media post", I hope to convey this message. What we see online is not really an accurate representation of real life.</p>
